# Planning Poker
Collaborative feature development effort estimation tool!

A web implementation of a common technique to estimate how complex a task is, a.k.a. "[Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker)".

## Setup & Running

First make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. Then follow the steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:tomhai/planning-poker.git
cd planning-poker/
npm instal
node server
open http://localhost:8000
```

## Notes
The demo uses a lot of ECMAScript6 features (Map Data-Structure, Arrow Functions, Template Literals, Value Export/Import) without using a precompiler, so be sure to use a modern browser that supports them.
